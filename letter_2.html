        Dear Tathai,
        <br>
        <br>
        Since you have told me to write letters so many time, I decided to
        write one but in my own style. So i took some time to write the lette, INSIDE OF A DAMN WEBSITE.
        Regardless, the letter will be a short one because i honestly lack the skill of writing (just trying to be humble).
        I wanted to say that when you take my hand and hold it so dearly, I love the feeling it gets going inside me. 
        I love it when you look at me with that expression of love in your beautiful dreamy eyes.
        I also love it so much when you scold me for little things as if you are my mother.
        And in the end I would like to say and keep saying it forever and ever:
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>I LOVE YOU!</h2>
